# Autoware Vehicle Adaptor

In order to perform adaptive control that allows various vehicles to operate without detailed parameter calibration, it is placed in the lower part of the controller and corrects the input so that the ideal state based on the internal model of the controller is achieved according to the learned model.
However, if you are not going to do any learning and simply want to drive on Autoware with the default NN model, you do not need to follow this installation procedure, and it is sufficient to just do the normal Autoware setup.
