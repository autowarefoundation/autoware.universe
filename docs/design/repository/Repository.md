## What is autoware.proj

autoware.proj is a meta-repository for AutowareArchitectureProposal.  
Since AutowareArchitectureProposal is made up of code stored in multiple, version-specific GitHub repositories, creating a new build environment would involve individually importing each repository which is both time-consuming and prone to error. To avoid both of these problems, autoware.proj was created as a meta-repository to streamline the management of all necessary repositories through the use of [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool).  

autoware.proj is the top directory of the AutowareArchitectureProposal project. Therefore, this repository contains high-level information of AutowareArchitectureProposal such as [the architecture design](/docs/design/software_architecture/Overview.md).
