// Specify whether GeographicLib is a shared or static library.  When compiling
// under Visual Studio it is necessary to specify whether GeographicLib is a
// shared library.  This is done with the macro GEOGRAPHICLIB_SHARED_LIB, which
// cmake will correctly define as 0 or 1 when only one type of library is in
// the package.  If both shared and static libraries are available,
// GEOGRAPHICLIB_SHARED_LIB is set to 2 which triggers a preprocessor error in
// Constants.hpp.  In this case, the appropriate value (0 or 1) for
// GEOGRAPHICLIB_SHARED_LIB must be specified when compiling any program that
// includes GeographicLib headers.  This is done automatically if GeographicLib
// and the user's code were built with cmake version 2.8.11 (which introduced
// the command target_compile_definitions) or later.
