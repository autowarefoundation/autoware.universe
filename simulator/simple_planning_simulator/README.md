# simple_planning_simulator

## Purpose / Use cases

This node simulates the vehicle motion for a vehicle command in 2D using a simple vehicle model.

## Design

The purpose of this simulator is for the integration test of planning and control modules. This does not simulate sensing or perception, but is implemented in pure c++ only and works without GPU.

## Assumptions / Known limits

- It simulates only in 2D motion.
- It does not perform physical operations such as collision and sensing, but only calculates the integral results of vehicle dynamics.

### Vehicle Model Parameters

#### vehicle_model_type options

- `IDEAL_STEER_VEL`
- `IDEAL_STEER_ACC`
- `IDEAL_STEER_ACC_GEARED`
- `DELAY_STEER_VEL`
- `DELAY_STEER_ACC`
- `DELAY_STEER_ACC_GEARED`
- `DELAY_STEER_ACC_GEARED_WO_FALL_GUARD`
- `DELAY_STEER_MAP_ACC_GEARED`: applies 1D dynamics and time delay to the steering and acceleration commands. The simulated acceleration is determined by a value converted through the provided acceleration map. This model is valuable for an accurate simulation with acceleration deviations in a real vehicle.
- `LEARNED_STEER_VEL`: launches learned python models. More about this [here](../learning_based_vehicle_model).

The following models receive `ACTUATION_CMD` generated from `raw_vehicle_cmd_converter`. Therefore, when these models are selected, the `raw_vehicle_cmd_converter` is also launched.

- `ACTUATION_CMD`: This model only converts accel/brake commands and use steer command as it is.
- `ACTUATION_CMD_STEER_MAP`: The steer command is converted to the steer rate command using the steer map.
- `ACTUATION_CMD_VGR`: The steer command is converted to the steer rate command using the variable gear ratio.
- `ACTUATION_CMD_MECHANICAL`: This model has mechanical dynamics and controller for that.

The `IDEAL` model moves ideally as commanded, while the `DELAY` model moves based on a 1st-order with time delay model. The `STEER` means the model receives the steer command. The `VEL` means the model receives the target velocity command, while the `ACC` model receives the target acceleration command. The `GEARED` suffix means that the motion will consider the gear command: the vehicle moves only one direction following the gear.

The table below shows which models correspond to what parameters. The model names are written in abbreviated form (e.g. IDEAL_STEER_VEL = I_ST_V).

_Note:_ Parameters `model_module_paths`, `model_param_paths`, and `model_class_names` need to have the same length.

The `acceleration_map` is used only for `DELAY_STEER_MAP_ACC_GEARED` and it shows the acceleration command on the vertical axis and the current velocity on the horizontal axis, with each cell representing the converted acceleration command that is actually used in the simulator's motion calculation. Values in between are linearly interpolated.

##### ACTUATION_CMD model

The simple_planning_simulator usually operates by receiving Control commands, but when the `ACTUATION_CMD*` model is selected, it receives Actuation commands instead of Control commands. This model can simulate the motion using the vehicle command that is actually sent to the real vehicle. Therefore, when this model is selected, the `raw_vehicle_cmd_converter` is also launched.
Please refer to the [actuation_cmd_sim.md](./docs/actuation_cmd_sim.md) for more details.

<!-- deadzone_delta_steer | double | dead zone for the steering dynamics                  | x      | x      | x        | o      | o      | 0.0      | [rad]         |         | -->

_Note_: The steering/velocity/acceleration dynamics is modeled by a first order system with a deadtime in a _delay_ model. The definition of the _time constant_ is the time it takes for the step response to rise up to 63% of its final value. The _deadtime_ is a delay in the response to a control input.

### Example of LEARNED_STEER_VEL model

We created a few basic models to showcase how `LEARNED_STEER_VEL` works.

1. Install [a library](https://github.com/atomyks/control_analysis_pipeline/tree/v0.1_autoware) that contains basic Python models. (branch: `v0.1_autoware`)

2. In a file `src/vehicle/sample_vehicle_launch/sample_vehicle_description/config/simulator_model.param.yaml` set `vehicle_model_type` to `LEARNED_STEER_VEL`. In the same file set the following parameters. These models are for testing and do not require any parameter file.

```yaml
model_module_paths:
  [
    "control_analysis_pipeline.autoware_models.vehicle.kinematic",
    "control_analysis_pipeline.autoware_models.steering.steer_example",
    "control_analysis_pipeline.autoware_models.drive.drive_example",
  ]
model_param_paths: ["", "", ""]
model_class_names: ["KinematicModel", "SteerExample", "DriveExample"]
```

### Default TF configuration

Since the vehicle outputs `odom`->`base_link` tf, this simulator outputs the tf with the same frame_id configuration.
In the simple_planning_simulator.launch.py, the node that outputs the `map`->`odom` tf, that usually estimated by the localization module (e.g. NDT), will be launched as well. Since the tf output by this simulator module is an ideal value, `odom`->`map` will always be 0.

### (Caveat) Pitch calculation

Ego vehicle pitch angle is calculated in the following manner.

NOTE: driving against the line direction (as depicted in image's bottom row) is not supported and only shown for illustration purposes.

## Error detection and handling

The only validation on inputs being done is testing for a valid vehicle model type.

## Security considerations

<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
- Spoofing (How do you check for and handle fake input?)
- Tampering (How do you check for and handle tampered input?)
- Repudiation (How are you affected by the actions of external actors?).
- Information Disclosure (Can data leak?).
- Denial of Service (How do you handle spamming?).
- Elevation of Privilege (Do you need to change permission levels during execution?) -->

- Cooperation with modules that output pseudo pointcloud or pseudo perception results
