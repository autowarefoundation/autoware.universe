# roi_detected_object_fusion

## Purpose

The `roi_detected_object_fusion` is a package to overwrite labels of detected objects with that of Region Of Interests (ROIs) by a 2D object detector.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

In what follows, we describe the algorithm utilized by `roi_detected_object_fusion` (the meaning of each parameter can be found in the `Parameters` section):

1. If the `existence_probability` of a detected object is greater than the threshold, it is accepted without any further processing and published in `output`.
2. The remaining detected objects are projected onto image planes, and if the resulting ROIs overlap with the ones from the 2D detector, they are published as fused objects in `output`. The Intersection over Union (IoU) is used to determine if there are overlaps between the detections from `input` and the ROIs from `input/rois`.

The DetectedObject has three possible shape choices/implementations, where the polygon's vertices for each case are defined as follows:

- `BOUNDING_BOX`: The 8 corners of a bounding box.
- `CYLINDER`: The circle is approximated by a hexagon.
- `POLYGON`: Not implemented yet.
