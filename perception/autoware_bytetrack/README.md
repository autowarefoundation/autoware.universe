# bytetrack

## Purpose

The core algorithm, named `ByteTrack`, mainly aims to perform multi-object tracking.
Because the algorithm associates almost every detection box including ones with low detection scores,
the number of false negatives is expected to decrease by using it.

### 2d tracking modification from original codes

The paper just says that the 2d tracking algorithm is a simple Kalman filter.
Original codes use the `top-left-corner` and `aspect ratio` and `size` as the state vector.

This is sometimes unstable because the aspect ratio can be changed by the occlusion.
So, we use the `top-left` and `size` as the state vector.

Kalman filter settings can be controlled by the parameters in `config/bytetrack_node.param.yaml`.
