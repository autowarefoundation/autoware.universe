# autoware_lidar_apollo_instance_segmentation

![Peek 2020-04-07 00-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8327598/78574862-92507d80-7865-11ea-9a2d-56d3453bdb7a.gif)

## Purpose

This node segments 3D pointcloud data from lidar sensors into obstacles, e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles, and pedestrians
based on CNN based model and obstacle clustering method.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

See the [original design](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/r6.0.0/docs/specs/3d_obstacle_perception.md) by Apollo.

## Inputs / Outputs

### Input

| Name               | Type                      | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `input/pointcloud` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | Pointcloud data from lidar sensors |

### Output

| Name                        | Type                                               | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `output/labeled_clusters`   | `tier4_perception_msgs/DetectedObjectsWithFeature` | Detected objects with labeled pointcloud cluster. |
| `debug/instance_pointcloud` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`                          | Segmented pointcloud for visualization.           |

## Parameters
{{ json_to_markdown("perception/autoware_lidar_apollo_instance_segmentation/schema/hdl-64.schema.json") }}

{{ json_to_markdown("perception/autoware_lidar_apollo_instance_segmentation/schema/vlp-16.schema.json") }}

{{ json_to_markdown("perception/autoware_lidar_apollo_instance_segmentation/schema/vls-128.schema.json") }}

## Assumptions / Known limits

There is no training code for CNN model.

### Note

This package makes use of three external codes.
The trained files are provided by apollo. The trained files are automatically downloaded when you build.

Supported lidars are velodyne 16, 64 and 128, but you can also use velodyne 32 and other lidars with good accuracy.
