This refers to the cutoff frequency in the second order Butterworth filter installed in the final layer. The smaller the cutoff frequency, the stronger the noise reduction, but it also induce operation delay.</li> <li>If the vehicle consistently deviates laterally from the trajectory, it's most often due to the offset of the steering sensor or self-position estimation. It's preferable to eliminate these biases before inputting into MPC, but it's also possible to remove this bias within MPC. To utilize this, set <code>enable_auto_steering_offset_removal</code> to true and activate the steering offset remover. The steering offset estimation logic works when driving at high speeds with the steering close to the center, applying offset removal.</li> <li>If the onset of steering in curves is late, it's often due to incorrect delay time and time constant in the steering model. Please recheck the values of <code>input_delay</code> and <code>vehicle_model_steer_tau</code>.

YabLoc includes a particle filter process that operates on a timer, and even when image topics are not streamed, the particle prediction process continues to work. To address this, the YabLoc stopper also has a service client for explicitly stopping and resuming YabLoc.  - **Eagleye**  The Eagleye stopper relays Eagleye's output pose topics in the backend of Eagleye's estimation process.

If pose_estimator involves time-series processing with heavy computations, it's not possible to pause and resume with just topic relaying.  In such cases, there may not be generally applicable solutions, but the following methods may help:  1. Completely stop and **reinitialize** time-series processing, as seen in the case of YabLoc. 2. Subscribe to `localization/kinematic_state` and **keep updating states** to ensure that the estimation does not break (relying on the output of the active pose_estimator). 3.

The velocity estimation uses the velocity information of dynamic objects or the travel distance of the target vehicle point from the previous step. The dynamic object information is primal, and the travel distance estimation is used as a backup in case of the perception failure. If the target vehicle point is contained in the bounding box of a dynamic object geometrically, the velocity of the dynamic object is used as the target point velocity.

The function also identifies which vehicle is in front by using the arc length along the given path. The function operates under the assumption that accurate data on the position, velocity, and shape of both the ego vehicle (the autonomous vehicle) and any target objects are available. It also relies on the yaw angle of each point in the predicted paths of these objects, which is expected to point towards the next path point.</p> <p>A critical part of the safety check is the calculation of the RSS (Responsibility-Sensitive Safety) distance-inspired algorithm.

In such cases, relying on a static drivable area is insufficient, since the static method depends on lane information provided by high-definition maps. To overcome the limitations of the static approach, the dynamic drivable area expansion algorithm adjusts the navigable space for an autonomous vehicle in real-time. It conserves computational power by reusing previously calculated path data, updating only when there is a significant change in the vehicle's position. The system evaluates the minimum lane width necessary to accommodate the vehicle's turning radius and other dynamic factors. It then calculates the optimal expansion of the drivable area's boundaries to ensure there is adequate space for safe maneuvering, taking into account the vehicle's path curvature. The rate at which these boundaries can expand or contract is moderated to maintain stability in the vehicle's navigation. The algorithm aims to maximize the drivable space while avoiding fixed obstacles and adhering to legal driving limits. Finally, it applies these boundary adjustments and smooths out the path curvature calculations to ensure a safe and legally compliant navigable path is maintained throughout the vehicle's operation.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The feature can be enabled in the drivable_area_expansion.param.yaml.</p>"},{"location":"planning/behavior_path_planner/autoware_behavior_path_planner/#generating-turn-signal","title":"Generating Turn Signal","text":"<p>The Behavior Path Planner module uses the <code>autoware_vehicle_msgs::msg::TurnIndicatorsCommand</code> to output turn signal commands (see TurnIndicatorsCommand.idl).

Assume the following ideal case.</p> <p></p> <p>In the image, <code>Linestring ID51</code> is shared by <code>Lanelet A</code> and <code>Lanelet B</code>. Hence we can directly use the available <code>left</code>, <code>adjacentLeft</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>adjacentRight</code> and <code>findUsages</code> method within <code>Lanelet2</code>'s API to directly query the direction and opposite lane availability.</p> <pre><code>const auto right_lane = routing_graph_ptr_-&gt;right(lanelet);\nconst auto adjacent_right_lane = routing_graph_ptr_-&gt;adjacentRight(lanelet);\nconst auto opposite_right_lane = lanelet_map_ptr_-&gt;laneletLayer.findUsages(lanelet.rightBound().invert());\n</code></pre> <p>The following images show the situation where these API does not work directly. This means that we cannot use them straight away, and several assumptions and logical instruction are needed to make these APIs work.</p> <p></p> <p>In this example (multiple linestring issues), <code>Lanelet C</code> contains <code>Linestring ID61</code> and <code>ID62</code>, while <code>Lanelet D</code> contains <code>Linestring ID63</code> and <code>ID 64</code>. Although the <code>Linestring ID62</code> and <code>ID64</code> have identical point IDs and seem visually connected, the API will treat these Linestring as though they are separated. When it searches for any <code>Lanelet</code> that is connected via <code>Linestring ID62</code>, it will return <code>NULL</code>, since <code>ID62</code> only connects to <code>Lanelet C</code> and not other <code>Lanelet</code>.</p> <p>Although, in this case, it is possible to forcefully search the lanelet availability by checking the lanelet that contains the points, using<code>getLaneletFromPoint</code> method. But, the implementation requires complex rules for it to work. Take the following images as an example.</p> <p></p> <p>Assume <code>Object X</code> is in <code>Lanelet F</code>. We can forcefully search <code>Lanelet E</code> via <code>Point 7</code>, and it will work if <code>Point 7</code> is utilized by only 2 lanelet. However, the complexity increases when we want to start searching for the direction of the opposite lane. We can infer the direction of the lanelet by using mathematical operations (dot product of vector <code>V_ID72</code> (<code>Point 6</code> minus <code>Point 9</code>), and <code>V_ID74</code> (<code>Point 7</code> minus <code>Point 8</code>). But, notice that we did not use Point 7 in V_ID72. This is because searching it requires an iteration, adding additional non-beneficial computation.</p> <p>Suppose the points are used by more than 2 lanelets. In that case, we have to find the differences for all lanelet, and the result might be undefined. The reason is that the differences between the coordinates do not reflect the actual shape of the lanelet. The following image demonstrates this point.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>There are many other available solutions to try. However, further attempt to solve this might cause issues in the future, especially for maintaining or scaling up the software.</p> <p>In conclusion, the multiple Linestring issues will not be supported.

By default, this feature is active, but it can be deactivated if necessary.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Static obstacle clearance from the path: This involves verifying that a sufficient margin around static obstacles is maintained. The process includes creating a vehicle-sized footprint from the current position to the pull-out endpoint, which can be adjusted via parameters. The distance to static obstacle polygons is then calculated. If this distance is below a specified threshold, the path is deemed unsafe. Threshold levels (e.g., [2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1]) can be configured, and the system searches for paths that meet the highest possible threshold based on a set search priority explained in following section, ensuring the selection of the safe path based on the policy. If no path meets the minimum threshold, it's determined that no safe path is available.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Clearance from stationary objects: Maintaining an adequate distance from stationary objects positioned in front of and behind the vehicle is imperative for safety.

Consider a scenario in a \"geometric pull out path\" where the clearance from the path to a static obstacle is minimal, and there is a stopped vehicle ahead. In this case, although the path may meet safety standards and thus be generated, a concurrently operating avoidance module might deem it impossible to avoid the obstacle, potentially leading to vehicle deadlock. To ensure there is enough distance for avoidance maneuvers, the distance to the front obstacle is assessed. Increasing this parameter can prevent immobilization within the avoidance module but may also lead to the frequent generation of backward paths or geometric pull out path, resulting in paths that may seem unnatural to humans.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why is a margin from the rear object necessary?   For objects ahead, another behavior module can intervene, allowing the path to overwrite itself through an avoidance plan, even if the clearance from the path to a static obstacle is minimal, thus maintaining a safe distance from static obstacles. However, for objects behind the vehicle, it is impossible for other behavior modules other than the start_planner to alter the path to secure a margin, potentially leading to a deadlock by an action module like \"obstacle_cruise_planner\" and subsequent immobilization.

Mostly, we've used <code>ros2 topic delay /topic_name</code> to measure the time between the message header and the current time. This approach works well for small-sized messages.
