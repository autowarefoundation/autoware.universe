# Crosswalk

## Role

This module judges whether the ego should stop in front of the crosswalk in order to provide safe passage for crosswalk users, such as pedestrians and bicycles, based on the objects' behavior and surround traffic.

## Features

### Yield the Way to the Pedestrians

#### Target Object

The crosswalk module handles objects of the types defined by the following parameters in the `object_filtering.target_object` namespace.

| Parameter    | Unit | Type | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `unknown`    | [-]  | bool | whether to look and stop by UNKNOWN objects    |
| `pedestrian` | [-]  | bool | whether to look and stop by PEDESTRIAN objects |
| `bicycle`    | [-]  | bool | whether to look and stop by BICYCLE objects    |
| `motorcycle` | [-]  | bool | whether to look and stop by MOTORCYCLE objects |

In order to handle the crosswalk users crossing the neighborhood but outside the crosswalk, the crosswalk module creates an attention area around the crosswalk, shown as the yellow polygon in the figure. If the object's predicted path collides with the attention area, the object will be targeted for yield.

</figure>

The neighborhood is defined by the following parameter in the `object_filtering.target_object` namespace.

| Parameter                   | Unit | Type   | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crosswalk_attention_range` | [m]  | double | the detection area is defined as -X meters before the crosswalk to +X meters behind the crosswalk |

#### Stop Position

First of all, `stop_distance_from_object [m]` is always kept at least between the ego and the target object for safety.

When the stop line exists in the lanelet map, the stop position is calculated based on the line.
When the stop line does **NOT** exist in the lanelet map, the stop position is calculated by keeping `stop_distance_from_crosswalk [m]` between the ego and the crosswalk.

            <td><img src="./docs/virtual_stop_line.svg" width="600"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

As an exceptional case, if a pedestrian (or bicycle) is crossing **wide** crosswalks seen in scramble intersections, and the pedestrian position is more than `far_object_threshold` meters away from the stop line, the actual stop position is determined by `stop_distance_from_object` and pedestrian position, not at the stop line.

In the `stop_position` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| `far_object_threshold`         | [m] | double | If objects cross X meters behind the stop line, the stop position is determined according to the object position (stop_distance_from_object meters before the object) for the case where the crosswalk width is very wide |
| `stop_distance_from_object`    | [m] | double | the vehicle decelerates to be able to stop in front of object with margin                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Yield decision

The module makes a decision to yield only when the pedestrian traffic light is **GREEN** or **UNKNOWN**.
The decision is based on the following variables, along with the calculation of the collision point.

- Time-To-Collision (TTC): The time for the **ego** to reach the virtual collision point.
- Time-To-Vehicle (TTV): The time for the **object** to reach the virtual collision point.

We classify ego behavior at crosswalks into three categories according to the relative relationship between TTC and TTV [1].

- A. **TTC >> TTV**: The object will pass early enough than the ego reach the collision point.
  - No stop planning.
- B. **TTC ≒ TTV**: There is a risk of collision.
  - **Stop point is inserted in the ego's path**.
- C. **TTC << TTV**: The ego will pass early enough than the object reach the collision point.
  - No stop planning.

The following figure shows the decision result for each TTC and TTV with the parameters, `ego_pass_first_margin_x` is `{0}`, `ego_pass_first_margin_y` is `{4}`, `ego_pass_later_margin_x` is `{0}`, and `ego_pass_later_margin_y` is `{13}`.

If the red signal is indicating to the corresponding crosswalk, the ego do not yield against the pedestrians.

In the `pass_judge` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

#### Smooth Yield Decision

If the object is stopped near the crosswalk but has no intention of walking, a situation can arise in which the ego continues to yield the right-of-way to the object.
To prevent such a deadlock situation, the ego will cancel yielding depending on the situation.

For the object stopped around the crosswalk but has no intention to walk (\*1), after the ego has keep stopping to yield for a specific time (\*2), the ego cancels the yield and starts driving.

\*1:
The time is calculated by the interpolation of distance between the object and crosswalk with `distance_set_for_no_intention_to_walk` and `timeout_set_for_no_intention_to_walk`.

In the `pass_judge` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                               |       | Type   | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `distance_set_for_no_intention_to_walk` | [[m]] | double | key sets to calculate the timeout for no intention to walk with interpolation   |
| `timeout_set_for_no_intention_to_walk`  | [[s]] | double | value sets to calculate the timeout for no intention to walk with interpolation |

\*2:
In the `pass_judge` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                    |     | Type   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout_ego_stop_for_yield` | [s] | double | If the ego maintains the stop for this amount of time, then the ego proceeds, assuming it has stopped long time enough. |

#### New Object Handling

Due to the perception's limited performance where the tree or poll is recognized as a pedestrian or the tracking failure in the crowd or occlusion, even if the surrounding environment does not change, the new pedestrian (= the new ID's pedestrian) may suddenly appear unexpectedly.
If this happens while the ego is going to pass the crosswalk, the ego will stop suddenly.

To deal with this issue, the option `disable_yield_for_new_stopped_object` is prepared.
If true is set, the yield decisions around the crosswalk with a traffic light will ignore the new stopped object.

In the `pass_judge` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                              |     | Type | Description                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | --- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `disable_yield_for_new_stopped_object` | [-] | bool | If set to true, the new stopped object will be ignored around the crosswalk with a traffic light |

### Stuck Prevention on the Crosswalk

The feature will make the ego not to stop on the crosswalk.
When there is a low-speed or stopped vehicle ahead of the crosswalk, and there is not enough space between the crosswalk and the vehicle, the crosswalk module plans to stop before the crosswalk even if there are no pedestrians or bicycles.

`min_acc`, `min_jerk`, and `max_jerk` are met. If the ego cannot stop before the crosswalk with these parameters, the stop position will move forward.

In the `stuck_vehicle` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                          | Unit    | Type   | Description                                                             |

| `max_stuck_vehicle_lateral_offset` | [m]     | double | maximum lateral offset of the target vehicle position                   |
| `required_clearance`               | [m]     | double | clearance to be secured between the ego and the ahead vehicle           |
| `min_acc`                          | [m/ss]  | double | minimum acceleration to stop                                            |
| `min_jerk`                         | [m/sss] | double | minimum jerk to stop                                                    |
| `max_jerk`                         | [m/sss] | double | maximum jerk to stop                                                    |

### Safety Slow Down Behavior

In the current autoware implementation, if no target object is detected around a crosswalk, the ego vehicle will not slow down for the crosswalk.
However, it may be desirable to slow down in situations, for example, where there are blind spots.
Such a situation can be handled by setting some tags to the related crosswalk as instructed in the [lanelet2_format_extension.md](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_lanelet2_extension/blob/main/autoware_lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md)
document.

| Parameter             |         | Type   | Description                                                                                                           |

| `slow_velocity`       | [m/s]   | double | target vehicle velocity when module receive slow down command from FOA                                                |
| `max_slow_down_jerk`  | [m/sss] | double | minimum jerk deceleration for safe brake                                                                              |
| `max_slow_down_accel` | [m/ss]  | double | minimum accel deceleration for safe brake                                                                             |
| `no_relax_velocity`   | [m/s]   | double | if the current velocity is less than X m/s, ego always stops at the stop position(not relax deceleration constraints) |

### Occlusion

This feature makes ego slow down for a crosswalk that is occluded.

Occlusion of the crosswalk is determined using the occupancy grid.
An occlusion is a square of size `min_size` of occluded cells
(i.e., their values are between `free_space_max` and `occupied_min`)
of size `min_size`.
If an occlusion is found within range of the crosswalk,
then the velocity limit at the crosswalk is set to `slow_down_velocity` (or more to not break limits set by `max_slow_down_jerk` and `max_slow_down_accel`).
The range is calculated from the intersection between the ego path and the crosswalk and is equal to the time taken by ego to reach the crosswalk times the `occluded_object_velocity`.
This range is meant to be large when ego is far from the crosswalk and small when ego is close.

In order to avoid flickering decisions, a time buffer can be used such that the decision to add (or remove) the slow down is only taken
after an occlusion is detected (or not detected) for a consecutive time defined by the `time_buffer` parameter.

To ignore occlusions when the crosswalk has a traffic light, `ignore_with_traffic_light` should be set to true.

To ignore temporary occlusions caused by moving objects,
`ignore_behind_predicted_objects` should be set to true.
By default, occlusions behind an object with velocity higher than `ignore_velocity_thresholds.default` are ignored.
This velocity threshold can be specified depending on the object type by specifying the object class label and velocity threshold in the parameter lists `ignore_velocity_thresholds.custom_labels` and `ignore_velocity_thresholds.custom_thresholds`.
To inflate the masking behind objects, their footprint can be made bigger using `extra_predicted_objects_size`.

## Known Issues

- The yield decision may be sometimes aggressive or conservative depending on the case.
  - The main reason is that the crosswalk module does not know the ego's position in the future. The detailed ego's position will be determined after the whole planning.
  - Currently the module assumes that the ego will move with a constant velocity.

## Debugging

### Visualization of debug markers

`/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_velocity_planner/debug/crosswalk` shows the following markers.

<figure markdown>
  ![limitation](docs/debug_markers.png){width=1000}
</figure>

- Yellow polygons
  - Ego footprints' polygon to calculate the collision check.
- Pink polygons
  - Object footprints' polygon to calculate the collision check.
- The color of crosswalks
  - Considering the traffic light's color, red means the target crosswalk, and white means the ignored crosswalk.
- Texts
  - It shows the module ID, TTC, TTV, and the module state.

### Visualization of Time-To-Collision

```sh
ros2 run autoware_behavior_velocity_crosswalk_module time_to_collision_plotter.py
```

enables you to visualize the following figure of the ego and pedestrian's time to collision.
The label of each plot is `<crosswalk module id>-<pedestrian uuid>`.

## Trouble Shooting

### Behavior

- Q. The ego stopped around the crosswalk even though there were no crosswalk user objects.
  - A. See [Stuck Vehicle Detection](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/pr-5583/planning/autoware_behavior_velocity_crosswalk_module/#stuck-vehicle-detection).
- Q. The crosswalk virtual wall suddenly appeared resulting in the sudden stop.
  - A. There may be a crosswalk user started moving when the ego was close to the crosswalk.
- Q. The crosswalk module decides to stop even when the pedestrian traffic light is red.
  - A. The lanelet map may be incorrect. The pedestrian traffic light and the crosswalk have to be related.
- Q. In the planning simulation, the crosswalk module does the yield decision to stop on all the crosswalks.
  - A. This is because the pedestrian traffic light is unknown by default. In this case, the crosswalk does the yield decision for safety.

### Parameter Tuning

- Q. The ego's yield behavior is too conservative.
  - A. Tune `ego_pass_later_margin` described in [Yield Decision](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/pr-5583/planning/autoware_behavior_velocity_crosswalk_module/#stuck-vehicle-detection)
- Q. The ego's yield behavior is too aggressive.
  - A. Tune `ego_pass_later_margin` described in [Yield Decision](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/pr-5583/planning/autoware_behavior_velocity_crosswalk_module/#stuck-vehicle-detection)
