#### Preprocess path

##### Calculate the expected target velocity for ego vehicle

Calculate the expected target velocity for the ego vehicle path to calculate time to collision with obstacles more precisely.
The expected target velocity is calculated with [autoware velocity smoother module](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/tree/main/planning/autoware_velocity_smoother) by using current velocity, current acceleration and velocity limits directed by the map and external API.

![brief](./docs/calculate_expected_target_velocity.svg)

##### Extend the path

The path is extended by the length of base link to front to consider obstacles after the goal.

##### Trim path from ego position

The path is trimmed from ego position to a certain distance to reduce calculation time.
Trimmed distance is specified by parameter of `detection_distance`.

#### Preprocess obstacles

##### Create data of abstracted dynamic obstacle

This module can handle multiple types of obstacles by creating abstracted dynamic obstacle data layer. Currently we have 3 types of detection method (Object, ObjectWithoutPath, Points) to create abstracted obstacle data.

###### Abstracted dynamic obstacle

Abstracted obstacle data has following information.

| Name             | Type                                                               | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pose             | `geometry_msgs::msg::Pose`                                         | pose of the obstacle                                                                                                   |
| classifications  | `std::vector<autoware_perception_msgs::msg::ObjectClassification>` | classifications with probability                                                                                       |
| shape            | `autoware_perception_msgs::msg::Shape`                             | shape of the obstacle                                                                                                  |
| predicted_paths  | `std::vector<DynamicObstacle::PredictedPath>`                      | predicted paths with confidence. this data doesn't have time step because we use minimum and maximum velocity instead. |
| min_velocity_mps | `float`                                                            | minimum velocity of the obstacle. specified by parameter of `dynamic_obstacle.min_vel_kmph`                            |
| max_velocity_mps | `float`                                                            | maximum velocity of the obstacle. specified by parameter of `dynamic_obstacle.max_vel_kmph`                            |

Enter the maximum/minimum velocity of the object as a parameter, adding enough margin to the expected velocity. This parameter is used to create polygons for [collision detection](.#Collision-detection).

Future work: Determine the maximum/minimum velocity from the estimated velocity with covariance of the object

###### 3 types of detection method

We have 3 types of detection method to meet different safety and availability requirements. The characteristics of them are shown in the table below.
Method of `Object` has high availability (less false positive) because it detects only objects whose predicted path is on the lane. However, sometimes it is not safe because perception may fail to detect obstacles or generate incorrect predicted paths.
On the other hand, method of `Points` has high safety (less false negative) because it uses pointcloud as input. Since points don't have a predicted path, the path that moves in the direction normal to the path of ego vehicle is considered to be the predicted path of abstracted dynamic obstacle data. However, without proper adjustment of filter of points, it may detect a lot of points and it will result in very low availability.
Method of `ObjectWithoutPath` has the characteristics of an intermediate of `Object` and `Points`.

| Method            | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object            | use an object with the predicted path for collision detection.                                                                                                        |
| ObjectWithoutPath | use an object but not use the predicted path for collision detection. replace the path assuming that an object jumps out to the lane at specified velocity.           |
| Points            | use filtered points for collision detection. the path is created assuming that points jump out to the lane. points are regarded as an small circular shaped obstacle. |

##### Exclude obstacles outside of partition

This module can exclude the obstacles outside of partition such as guardrail, fence, and wall.
We need lanelet map that has the information of partition to use this feature.
By this feature, we can reduce unnecessary deceleration by obstacles that are unlikely to jump out to the lane.
You can choose whether to use this feature by parameter of `use_partition_lanelet`.

![brief](./docs/exclude_obstacles_by_partition.svg)

##### Exclude obstacles by label

This module only acts on target obstacles defined by the `target_obstacle_types` parameter. If an obstacle of a type not specified by said parameter is detected, it will be ignored by this module.

##### Exclude obstacles that are already on the ego vehicle's path

In the cases were an obstacle is already on the ego vehicle's path, it cannot "cut in" into the ego's path anymore (which is the situation this module tries to handle) so it might be useful to exclude obstacles already on the vehicle's footprint path. By setting the parameter `exclude_obstacles_already_in_path` to true, this module will exclude the obstacles that are considered to be already on the ego vehicle's path for more than `keep_obstacle_on_path_time_threshold`. The module considers the ego vehicle's closest path point to each obstacle's current position, and determines the lateral distance between the obstacle and the right and left sides of the ego vehicle. If the obstacle is located within the left and right extremes of the vehicle for that pose, then it is considered to be inside the ego vehicle's footprint path and it is excluded. The virtual width of the vehicle used to detect if an obstacle is within the path or not, can be adjusted by the `ego_footprint_extra_margin` parameter.

##### Exclude obstacles that cross the ego vehicle's "cut line"

This module can exclude obstacles that have predicted paths that will cross the back side of the ego vehicle. It excludes obstacles if their predicted path crosses the ego's "cut line". The "cut line" is a virtual line segment that is perpendicular to the ego vehicle and that passes through the ego's base link.

You can choose whether to use this feature by setting the parameter `use_ego_cut_line` to `true` or `false`. The width of the line can be tuned with the parameter `ego_cut_line_length`.

![brief](./docs/ego_cut_line.svg)

#### Collision detection

##### Detect collision with dynamic obstacles

Along the ego vehicle path, determine the points where collision detection is to be performed for each `detection_span`.

The travel times to the each points are calculated from [the expected target velocity](.#Calculate-the-expected-target-velocity-for-ego-vehicle).

![brief](./docs/create_polygon_on_path_point.svg)

For the each points, collision detection is performed using the footprint polygon of the ego vehicle and the polygon of the predicted location of the obstacles.
The predicted location of the obstacles is described as rectangle or polygon that has the range calculated by min velocity, max velocity and the ego vehicle's travel time to the point.
If the input type of the dynamic obstacle is `Points`, the obstacle shape is defined as a small cylinder.

![brief](./docs/collision_detection_for_shape.svg)

Multiple points are detected as collision points because collision detection is calculated between two polygons.
So we select the point that is on the same side as the obstacle and close to ego vehicle as the collision point.

![brief](./docs/collision_points.svg)

#### Insert velocity

##### Insert velocity to decelerate for obstacles

If the collision is detected, stop point is inserted on distance of base link to front + stop margin from the selected collision point. The base link to front means the distance between base_link (center of rear-wheel axis) and front of the car. Stop margin is determined by the parameter of `stop_margin`.

![brief](./docs/insert_velocity.svg)

#### Insert velocity to approach the obstacles

If you select the method of `Points` or `ObjectWithoutPath`, sometimes ego keeps stopping in front of the obstacle.
To avoid this problem, This feature has option to approach the obstacle with slow velocity after stopping.
If the parameter of `approaching.enable` is set to true, ego will approach the obstacle after ego stopped for `state.stop_time_thresh` seconds.
The maximum velocity of approaching can be specified by the parameter of `approaching.limit_vel_kmph`.
The decision to approach the obstacle is determined by a simple state transition as following image.

![brief](./docs/insert_velocity_to_approach.svg)

```plantuml
@startuml
hide empty description
left to right direction
title State transition for approaching the obstacle

GO --> STOP : Current velocity is less than threshold
STOP --> GO : Current velocity is larger than threshold

STOP --> APPROACH : Stop duration is larger than threshold
APPROACH --> GO : There are no obstacles or \n distance to the obstacle is larger than threshold
APPROACH --> APPROACH : Approach duration is less than threshold
@enduml
```

##### Limit velocity with specified jerk and acc limit

The maximum slowdown velocity is calculated in order not to slowdown too much.
See the [Occlusion Spot document](../autoware_behavior_velocity_occlusion_spot_module/#maximum-slowdown-velocity) for more details.
You can choose whether to use this feature by parameter of `slow_down_limit.enable`.
