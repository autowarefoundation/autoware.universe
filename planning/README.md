# Planning Components

## Getting Started

The Autoware.Universe Planning Modules represent a cutting-edge component within the broader open-source autonomous driving software stack. These modules play a pivotal role in autonomous vehicle navigation, skillfully handling route planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and real-time adaptation to varied traffic conditions.

- For high level concept of Planning Components, please refer to [Planning Component Design Document](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-architecture/planning/)
- To understand how Planning Components interacts with other components, please refer to [Planning Component Interface Document](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-interfaces/components/planning/)
- The [Node Diagram](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-architecture/node-diagram/) illustrates the interactions, inputs, and outputs of all modules in the Autoware.Universe, including planning modules.

## Planning Module

The **Module** in the Planning Component refers to the various components that collectively form the planning system of the software. These modules cover a range of functionalities necessary for autonomous vehicle planning. Autoware's planning modules are modularized, meaning users can customize which functions are enabled by changing the configuration. This modular design allows for flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios and requirements in autonomous vehicle operations.

### How to Enable or Disable Planning Module

Enabling and disabling modules involves managing settings in key configuration and launch files.

### Key Files for Configuration

The `default_preset.yaml` file acts as the primary configuration file, where planning modules can be disabled or enabled. Furthermore, users can also set the type of motion planner across various motion planners. For example:

- `launch_avoidance_module`: Set to `true` to enable the avoidance module, or `false` to disable it.
- `motion_stop_planner_type`: Set `default` to either `obstacle_stop_planner` or `obstacle_cruise_planner`.

!!! note

    Click [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/blob/main/autoware_launch/config/planning/preset/default_preset.yaml) to view the `default_preset.yaml`.

The [launch files](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/launch/tier4_planning_launch/launch/scenario_planning/lane_driving) reference the settings defined in `default_preset.yaml` to apply the configurations when the behavior path planner's node is running. For instance, the parameter `avoidance.enable_module` in

```xml
<param name="avoidance.enable_module" value="$(var launch_avoidance_module)"/>
```

corresponds to launch_avoidance_module from `default_preset.yaml`.

### Parameter Configuration

There are multiple parameters available for configuration, and users have the option to modify them in [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/tree/main/autoware_launch/config/planning). It's important to note that not all parameters are adjustable via `rqt_reconfigure`. To ensure the changes are effective, modify the parameters and then restart Autoware. Additionally, detailed information about each parameter is available in the corresponding documents under the planning tab.

### Integrating a Custom Module into Autoware: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide outlines the steps for integrating your custom module into Autoware:

- Add your modules to the `default_preset.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml
- arg:
  name: launch_intersection_module
  default: "true"
```

- Incorporate your modules into the [launcher](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/launch/tier4_planning_launch/launch/scenario_planning). For example, in [behavior_planning.launch.xml](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/main/launch/tier4_planning_launch/launch/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_planning.launch.xml):

```xml
<arg name="launch_intersection_module" default="true"/>

<let
  name="behavior_velocity_planner_launch_modules"
  value="$(eval &quot;'$(var behavior_velocity_planner_launch_modules)' + 'behavior_velocity_planner::IntersectionModulePlugin, '&quot;)"
  if="$(var launch_intersection_module)"
/>
```

- If applicable, place your parameter folder within the appropriate existing parameter folder. For example, [intersection_module's parameters](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/blob/main/autoware_launch/config/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_velocity_planner/intersection.param.yaml) are in [behavior_velocity_planner](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/tree/main/autoware_launch/config/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_velocity_planner).
- Insert the path of your parameters in the [tier4_planning_component.launch.xml](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/blob/main/autoware_launch/launch/components/tier4_planning_component.launch.xml). For example, `behavior_velocity_planner_intersection_module_param_path` is used.

```xml
<arg name="behavior_velocity_planner_intersection_module_param_path" value="$(var behavior_velocity_config_path)/intersection.param.yaml"/>
```

- Define your parameter path variable within the corresponding launcher. For example, in [behavior_planning.launch.xml](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/04aa54bf5fb0c88e70198ca74b9ac343cc3457bf/launch/tier4_planning_launch/launch/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_planning.launch.xml#L191)

```xml
<param from="$(var behavior_velocity_planner_intersection_module_param_path)"/>
```

!!! note

    Depending on the specific module you wish to add, the relevant files and steps may vary. This guide provides a general overview and serves as a starting point. It's important to adapt these instructions to the specifics of your module.
