# bluetooth_monitor

## Description

This node monitors a Bluetooth connection to a wireless device by using L2ping.<br>
L2ping generates PING echo command on Bluetooth L2CAP layer, and it is able to receive and check echo response from a wireless device.

## Block diagram

L2ping is only allowed for root by default, so this package provides the following approach to minimize security risks as much as possible:

- Provide a small program named `l2ping_service` which performs L2ping and provides wireless device information to `bluetooth_monitor` by using socket programming.
- `bluetooth_monitor` is able to know wireless device information and L2ping status as an unprivileged user since those information are sent by socket communication.

## Parameters

{{ json_to_markdown("system/autoware_bluetooth_monitor/schema/bluetooth_monitor.schema.json") }}

- `rtt_warn`

  - **0.00(zero)**: Disable checking RTT
  - **otherwise**: Check RTT with specified seconds

- `addresses`
  - **\***: All connected devices
  - **AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF**: You can specify a device to monitor by setting a Bluetooth address

## Instructions before starting

- You can skip this instructions if you run `l2ping_service` as root user.

1. Assign capability to `l2ping_service` since L2ping requires `cap_net_raw+eip` capability.

   ```sh
   sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw+eip' ./build/bluetooth_monitor/l2ping_service
   ```

2. Run `l2ping_service` and `bluetooth_monitor`.

   ```sh
   ./build/bluetooth_monitor/l2ping_service
   ros2 launch autoware_bluetooth_monitor bluetooth_monitor.launch.xml
   ```

## Known limitations and issues

None.
