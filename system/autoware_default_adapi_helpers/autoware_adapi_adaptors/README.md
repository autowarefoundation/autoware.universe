## initial_pose_adaptor

This node makes it easy to use the localization AD API from RViz.
When a initial pose topic is received, call the localization initialize API.
This node depends on the map height fitter library.
[See here for more details.](../../../map/autoware_map_height_fitter/README.md)

## routing_adaptor

This node makes it easy to use the routing AD API from RViz.
When a goal pose topic is received, reset the waypoints and call the API.
When a waypoint pose topic is received, append it to the end of the waypoints to call the API.
The clear API is called automatically before setting the route.
