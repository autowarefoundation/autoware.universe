# autoware_control_command_gate

## Overview

This package subscribes to multiple commands, selects one and publish it.
Here, unless otherwise specified, command refers to a set of four commands: control, gear, turn_indicators, and hazard_lights.
Each command input is identified as a command source, an arbitrary string.
The node also applies a nominal filter to the selected commands to correct for obvious abnomal values.
